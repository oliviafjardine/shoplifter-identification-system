# 🛡️ Professional Shoplifting Detection System

A production-ready **live camera surveillance system** for detecting potential shoplifting behavior in retail environments using real-time computer vision and machine learning.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚠️ Prerequisites
- **Live Camera Required**: USB camera or webcam must be connected
- **No Demo Mode**: System requires real camera input to function

### Option 1: Quick Development Setup
```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

### Option 2: Production Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh deploy
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install full ML/CV dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Train the detection model (optional - pre-trained model included)
python3 train_model.py

# Run live camera detection system
python3 main.py
```
