# Shoplifting Detection System - Accuracy Improvement Report

## Executive Summary

This report details the comprehensive improvements made to the shoplifting detection system, resulting in enhanced accuracy, better performance tracking, and more realistic detection capabilities.

## Current System Performance

### Before Improvements
- **Detection Accuracy**: 0% (all scores were 0.00)
- **Stage Progression**: Non-functional
- **False Negative Rate**: 100% (missing all actual shoplifting)
- **Performance Tracking**: None
- **Threshold Sensitivity**: Too high (0.6-0.9 range)

### After Improvements
- **Detection Accuracy**: 50% (2/4 test scenarios correct)
- **Stage Progression**: Functional (browsing ‚Üí taking)
- **Shelf Interaction Detection**: ‚úÖ Working (0.30 confidence)
- **Performance Tracking**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive metrics
- **Threshold Sensitivity**: Improved (0.4-0.7 range)

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Detection Threshold Optimization
```python
# OLD THRESHOLDS (Too High)
shelf_interaction_threshold = 0.6
concealment_threshold = 0.7
shoplifting_threshold = 0.9

# NEW THRESHOLDS (More Sensitive)
shelf_interaction_threshold = 0.4  # ‚Üì 33% more sensitive
concealment_threshold = 0.5        # ‚Üì 29% more sensitive  
shoplifting_threshold = 0.7        # ‚Üì 22% more sensitive
```

### 2. Enhanced Behavior Analysis
- **Improved Shelf Proximity Scoring**: Added distance-based confidence
- **Better Time-Based Detection**: Longer stationary = higher score
- **More Sensitive Bbox Analysis**: Lowered change threshold from 0.3 to 0.2
- **Reduced Minimum Requirements**: Faster detection with fewer position samples

### 3. Performance Tracking System
```python
# New Performance Metrics
- Real-time accuracy calculation
- Precision and recall tracking
- False positive/negative rate monitoring
- Detection latency measurement
- Performance history logging
```

### 4. Configuration Optimization System
- **Automatic Threshold Adjustment**: Based on performance feedback
- **Environment-Specific Configs**: Different settings for store types
- **Optimization History**: Track changes over time
- **Performance Predictions**: Estimate improvement impact

## Current Detection Capabilities

### ‚úÖ Working Features
1. **Shelf Interaction Detection**: Successfully detects when person approaches and interacts with shelves
2. **Stage Progression**: Advances from "browsing" to "taking" stage
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides meaningful scores (0.30 for shelf interactions)
4. **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive accuracy tracking
5. **False Positive Control**: Correctly identifies normal browsing as non-suspicious

### ‚ùå Areas Needing Further Improvement
1. **Concealment Detection**: Not triggering despite realistic test data
2. **Final Shoplifting Confirmation**: Not reaching "shoplifting" stage
3. **Exit Movement Detection**: Not detecting movement toward exits
4. **Overall Accuracy**: Currently 50%, target is 85%+
